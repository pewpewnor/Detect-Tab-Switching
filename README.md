# How To Use
* Open the index.html using a browser
* Switch from the index.html website tab to another tab
* Go back to the index.html website to see whether it detected that you switched tabs

# Note
* Some of the tab detection methods include several strategies that are unlikely to be used in real word scenarios due to the nature of their reliability
* Another method of tab detecttion also includes pinging a server every now and then, this method is used by websites such as Hackerrank (this project does not cover this)
